This project provides a reference architecture for building a **Physical AI** system that demonstrates the convergence of **Agentic AI**, **IoT**, and **Robotics**. It showcases how Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical action by combining Agentic AI reasoning, Robotic autonomy, and IoT sensing to create systems capable of autonomous decision-making and real-world action in industrial environments.

## Overview

This demo showcases a next-generation industrial safety management solution that combines Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, AWS IoT services, and Robotics. An intelligent robotic system autonomously patrols hazardous areas, collecting data and performing edge inference, while an AI agent comprehensively analyzes this information to control patrol routes and responses in real-time. This enables dramatically improved accident prevention rates and response speeds in industrial environments where human access is difficult or dangerous.

## 🔍 Core Components

## 🧠 Agentic AI for Autonomous Robotics

- **LLM-driven Autonomy**: Powers intelligent decision-making beyond pre-programmed logic
- **Bedrock AgentCore Deployment**: AI Agent and MCP server operate in unified environment, following an Agentic AI pattern
- **Dynamic Planning**: Interprets complex situations and plans patrol routes by integrating sensor data, video analysis, and user requests
- **Context-aware Decision**: Maintains operational context for intelligent response to unpredictable situations

## 🗣️ Natural Language Command Interface

- **Conversational Control**: Enables intuitive robot control (e.g., "Patrol the storage area")
- **Intelligent Query**: Performs intent recognition and converts user requests into structured commands
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized, extensible interface between AI Agent and robot hardware, ensuring natural language maps directly to precise robotic actions

## 🤖 Physical AI: IoT-Enabled Robotics

- **Autonomous Embodiment**: Robot acts as physical embodiment of AI agent for real-world action
- **Real-world Task Execution**: Autonomous patrolling and hazard detection (fire, unsafe gestures, gas leaks, etc.)
- **Edge-Cloud Hybrid Architecture**: Distributed inference optimizes response time and computational efficiency

## 📡 IoT & Edge Intelligence

- **Secure Device Communication**: **AWS IoT Core** manages bidirectional data flow between robot fleet and cloud
- **Distributed Processing**: AWS IoT Greengrass enables low-latency edge inference; cloud performs deep analysis
